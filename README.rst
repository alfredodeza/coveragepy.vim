coveragepy.vim
==============
A Vim plugin to help integrate Ned Batchelder's excellent ``coverage.py`` (see:
http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/) tool into the editor.

Allows you to bring up a buffer with detailed information from a coverage
report command and mark each line in your source that is not being covered.

You can also use that buffer to navigate into files that have reported missing
statements and display the missed lines.

Optionally, you can also hide or display the marks as you make progress.

Installation
------------
If you have Tim Pope's Pathogen you only need to place the plugin directory
inside your bundle dir, otherwise it is a single file that should go into::

    vim/ftplugin/python/

Usage
=====
This plugin provides a single command: ``Coveragepy`` that accepts a few
arguments. Each argument and its usage is described in detail below.

Whenever a ``report`` or a ``session`` is called the cursor will be placed on
the first uncovered line if any.

``report``
--------
The main action is performed with this command (same as with ``coverage.py``) and
when it runs it calls ``coverage.py`` and loads the information into a split
buffer.

It also collects all the information needed to be able to mark all lines from
files that have reported missing coverage statements. To run this command do::

    :Coveragepy report


``session``
-----------
This argument toggles the reporting buffer (closes it is open or opens if it is
not already there). Makes sense to map it directly as a shortcut as it is
completely toggable.

A big plus on this session buffer is that you can navigate through the list of
reported paths (it actually circles through!) with the arrow keys or j and k.

If you want to navigate to a reported path that has missing lines just hit
Enter (or Return) and the plugin will go to the previous window and open that
selected file and then display the missing lines.


``show``
--------
Shows or hides the actual Vim `sign` marks that display which lines are missing
coverage. It is implemented as a toggable argument so it will do the opposite
of what is currently shown.
It is useful to be able to hide these if you are already aware about the lines
that need to be covered and do not want to be visually disturbed by the signs.


``version``
-----------
Displays the current plugin version
